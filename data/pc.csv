Main Features:

- Thermal pad has 12.8 W/m K Thermal Conductivity, Used to fill the gap between the heating element and the Heatsink, Achieve the best cooling effect. At the same time, the thermal pad also has Insulation, Non-conductive, wear-resistant, fire-retardant, compression, buffering, no damage to metal materials, etc effect.
 
Why use thermal silicone Pad?

The main purpose of the choice of Thermal Pad is to reduce the heat source surface and the heat dissipation device contact surface between the contact thermal resistance. Thermal conductivity of silicone Pad can be good filling the gap between the contact surface;

Because the air is hot bad conductor, will seriously hinder the heat transfer between the contact surface, And in the heat source and the radiator between the installation of thermal silica Pad can be out of the air contact surface;

With thermal silicone Pad supplement, you can make the heat source and the heat sink between the contact surface better full contact, Truly face to face contact in the temperature of the reaction can be achieved as small as possible temperature difference.

The main purpose of the choice of Thermal Pad is to reduce the heat source surface and the heat dissipation device contact surface between the contact thermal resistance. Thermal conductivity of silicone Pad can be good filling the gap between the contact surface;

Because the air is hot bad conductor, will seriously hinder the heat transfer between the contact surface, And in the heat source and the radiator between the installation of thermal silica Pad can be out of the air contact surface;

With thermal silicone Pad supplement, you can make the heat source and the heat sink between the contact surface better full contact, Truly face to face contact in the temperature of the reaction can be achieved as small as possible temperature difference.

It's crucial to choose a pad with dimensions suitable for the specific application, whether it's for a CPU or GPU.

Material: Thermal pads are typically made of materials with good thermal conductivity, such as silicone-based compounds. These materials help transfer heat away from the source (CPU/GPU) to improve cooling.

Heat Dissipation: The primary purpose of the thermal pad is to enhance heat dissipation by providing a direct interface between the heat source (CPU/GPU) and the cooling solution (heatsink or cooling device).

Ease of Application: Thermal pads are known for being easy to apply compared to thermal paste. They often come in pre-cut sizes or can be trimmed to fit specific components.

Non-Conductive: Thermal pads are generally non-conductive, ensuring that they won't cause electrical issues if they come into contact with other components on the motherboard.

Compatibility: The pad is likely designed for compatibility with various CPU and GPU models. Check the product specifications and compatibility list to ensure it suits your specific hardware.

Thickness: Thermal pads come in different thicknesses. The thickness of the pad can impact the thermal conductivity, and choosing the right thickness is crucial for optimal performance.

High Thermal Conductivity: A quality thermal pad is expected to have high thermal conductivity to efficiently transfer heat away from the source.

Durability: A good thermal pad is designed to be durable and maintain its thermal properties over time, even with repeated heating and cooling cycles.

Ease of Application: The paste is designed for easy application. Some thermal pastes come with applicator tools or are pre-applied on coolers for user convenience.

Compatibility: The TF4 thermal paste is likely compatible with a range of CPU and GPU sockets. Verify compatibility with your specific hardware before application.

Temperature Range: The paste should function effectively within a specified temperature range, ensuring stability under normal operating conditions.

Performance: Look for information on the thermal conductivity performance, and whether the thermal paste is suitable for applications where efficient heat dissipation is crucial.

Longevity: The thermal paste is expected to maintain its effectiveness over time, contributing to long-term stable thermal performance.

Storage: Proper storage conditions are important to maintain the effectiveness of the thermal paste. Check for any specific storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.",1x Thermalright TF4 1.5g Thermal Paste,,17.9,2,AU,,,,,
